# Data Structures and Algorithms

This repository that will help document some of my progress in learning about Data Structures and Algorithms. Below is some of the things that I want to cover. 

**Disclaimer**: This is not a school assignment and is something I'm doing for my own benefit, so I don't make the attempt to perfect it, make it original, or always put things in my own words, or cite my sources. 

## Plan 
- Read and learn about Data Structures from Aditya's Grokking Algorithms everyday until complete to build on foundation.
  - Manually type out and execute examples from [grokking_algorithms](https://github.com/egonschiele/grokking_algorithms)
- [x] Start doing 0.5h of HackerRank a day. 
  - I started doing this on January 25, 2021. 

## The Essentials

According to [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/landing-a-software-engineering-internship-66e0d541539a/), "some of the most useful things in Python to know for interviews... are":
- [defaultdict](https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.defaultdict)
- [sorting with a lambda](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3766633/how-to-sort-with-lambda-in-python)
- [string splitting/reversing/joining](https://www.guru99.com/learning-python-strings-replace-join-split-reverse.html)
- [built-in data types](https://python.swaroopch.com/data_structures.html)

### Data Structures & Algorithms 
According to an [Engineering Director on Reddit: lHere's How to Prepare for Tech Interviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1jov24/heres_how_to_prepare_for_tech_interviews/):
- Arrays
- Linked Lists
- Stacks/Queues
- Trees (Tree, Binary Tree, Binary Search Tree, Red-Black Tree, Learn a lot)
- Heap
- Hash Table (super important to understand different collision mitigation mechanisms, understand what amortized constant-time means)
- Directed/Undirected/Weighted Graphs
- Trie ("pronounced 'tree'")
- Linked Hash Map (comes up a LOT in interviews)

#### What should you know about the above data structures?
- Big O for:
  - insert
  - delete
  - look up
  - etc for each
- How the mechanics work 
- How to code/implement the above data structures from scratch
- Some real world examples for when to use those D.S.?
- Why those D.S. are the best choice for a given example? 
  - Be able to explain trade offs. 

### Algorithms 
- Sorting Algorithms - Comparisons and non-comparison sorting
- Tree Traversals - inorder, preorder, postorder, level order traversals... memorize all of these
- Traversals - Dijkstra's, A*, BFS, DFS
  - Know the difference between DFS and BFS, trade-offs, and when to use one over  the other. 
  - Be able to code recursively and use stack/queue
- Pre-fix tree searches

### Practice
- Find interview questions and code the answers to these questions. 
- Try to get the questions solved within 10-15 minutes, sometimes 20-25 minutes. 
- Organize your thoughts and figure out the solution _before_ writing one line of code. 

### Important Stuff You Don't Want to Practice
- Bits and Bytes: 
  - How does bitshifting work in X language (Python)?
  - What is big and little endian? 
  - Practice questions, like "Write a method to determine if a bit-wise representation of an itneger is a palindrome?"
- How the internet works:
  - How socks work
  - What is TCP/IP
  - What is HTTP 
  - What are the networking layers? What's responsible for what?
- Databases:
  - Know basic sql and data modeling if the job uses databases
- Testing: Write some code and test it.
  - What is TDD?
