# Cracking the Coding Interview

## Purpose

The purpose of this folder is to contain my notes as I read _Cracking the Coding Interview_ by Gayle Laakman. I've been wanting to eventually get to CTCI for a while and briefly read portions of it before, but my friends had convinced me that Python would be a better language for technical interviews. My recent thoughts about mastery, building up career capital, and immersion in the software development world has changed my focus. I want to engage in a depth-first approach in which I focus on building up my Java skills first, because my internship uses Java, my school uses Java, and CTCI uses Java. There's a limited amount of energy in the day, especially when I want to take excellent care of myself (e.g. with exercise, sleeping a lot, reading fiction, journaling, meditating, maintaining connections). I've noticed that while Python may be easier for the interviews and easier to pick up than Java, trying to learn both Python and Java at the same time (for my schedule) actually takes away from learning both. Right now, this switch to CTCI is the acknowledgement that I am a human, with a limited amount of time, and that I can make more progress by staying consistent with Java, getting my foundation there, and then expanding to Python later after I've gotten an actual job!
