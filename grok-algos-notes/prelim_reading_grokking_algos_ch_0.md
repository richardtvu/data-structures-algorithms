	- What are **breadth-first search** and **Dijkstra's algorithim**? 
		- Ways to find the shortest distance between two nodes in a network 
- What is **K-nearest neighbors** (KNN)? 
	- A machine-learning algorithm that helps you build recommendation systems, OCR engine, or other predictive system. 

## How to use the book? 
- Go in order, unless you're interested in a particular topic because they build on each other. 
- Type out and execute the code for the examples yourself.
