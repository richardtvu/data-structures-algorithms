# Practice Scripts

The purpose of this folder is to contain attempts to recall different data structures and algorithms. While practice may not necessarily make perfect, practice does help with ingraining what you practice into memory. This folder will serve as an indication of the progress made over time in recall. Therefore, some recall attempts might be wrong, or even completely wrong. After all, _most_ people aren't experts at what they do when they first start out. I'm learning about the fundamentals and building up my skills in data structures and algorithms, so I will start off not as great as I'd like to be :) and get better over time with practice, reflection, and modification of practice.
