Your computer memory is like a "chest of drawers". When you have items to store, the computer will assign you some drawers to leave things in.

Each of the drawers has an address.

What's the general process for storing items?

1. Get some space in the memory
2. Get the address to this space
3. Use either an array or list to store the items 

## Arrays and linked lists

How are arrays stored in memory?

* The  items in an array are stored **contiguously**, i.e. right next to each other in the memory space. 

What happens if there isn't enough allocated space to store everything next to each other?
- You have to ask the computer for another memory spot.
