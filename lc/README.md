# README

LC stands for **leetcode**. 

I found what seems to be a great list of curated problems for learning data structures and algorithms. I'm interested in checking it out [here](https://www.hackerearth.com/blog/developers/7-steps-to-improve-your-data-structure-and-algorithm-skills/). 

I'll try to include my notes or solutions to help document my learning process!
